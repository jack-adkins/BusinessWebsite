                Welcome to Boston Glass, a family-owned glassblowing studio where tradition, artistry, and craftsmanship come together to create one-of-a-kind pieces. For generations, our family has been dedicated to the art of glassblowing, passing down time-honored techniques and a passion for creativity from one generation to the next. Nestled in the heart of Boston, our studio reflects the city’s rich history and vibrant artistic community, infusing each of our creations with a touch of New England’s timeless charm.

                Boston Glass began as a small workshop in the early 1970s, founded by our grandparents who fell in love with the mesmerizing process of shaping molten glass into beautiful, intricate forms. What started as a hobby in their garage quickly turned into a lifelong pursuit, and soon, they transformed their passion into a full-fledged business. With a little help from friends and family, they built a studio and began sharing their craft with the community, creating pieces that have been cherished for decades.

                Today, we continue that legacy with the same love for glassblowing and a commitment to quality that our grandparents instilled in us. As a family-run business, we work side by side to craft each piece with care, whether it's a delicate ornament, a custom vase, or a striking art installation. Our studio is a place where family, tradition, and creativity intersect, and we take pride in sharing that connection with everyone who visits.

Our mission is to create stunning, timeless pieces that not only capture the light but also the hearts of those who see them. As a family, we strive to preserve the traditional artistry of glassblowing while pushing the boundaries of contemporary design. We are dedicated to providing our customers with unique, high-quality products and a personalized experience that reflects our family’s values of honesty, integrity, and craftsmanship.
